# Overview
**sea** is a project, which is expected to run in **Severe**, it serves as an external save-instace.

# Usage
Download `server.exe`, run it, and then execute `client.lua`.

# Goals
- [ ] Terrain: not my priority, but it'd be nice to add eitherways.
- [ ] Scripts: requires a decompiler, this is possible in the future.
- [ ] Editable Assets: (unions, meshes) essentially the same as terrain.
- [ ] Attributes & tags
- [x] Parts
- [ ] GuiObjects
- [ ] Lighting

# Known Issues
- Meshes are too big: this is an issue with Lune most likely, so I don't know how to fix it.

# Contribution
I'd be very grateful for any contributors, so if you feel like it, you can open a pull request and detail your changes.
